"""FG-03 Shape 1 — one brain, all channels (contract C4).

Every incoming channel (each WhatsApp number, each email inbox, each calendar,
…) is just a different *input* into the **one shared agent brain**. This module
is the Shape-1 transport that realises that principle without a per-channel or
per-account silo:

* **Producers are thin normalisers.** A poller/bridge/cron converts a raw
  channel payload into a channel-neutral :class:`InboundEvent` tagged with the
  *receiving* ``account_id`` (which of my inboxes took it in) — it does NOT run
  its own bespoke triage brain. See :mod:`gateway.producers`.
* **One in-process queue + a bounded worker pool.** Events are submitted to an
  :class:`InboundRouter` which routes each to the single shared ``AIAgent``
  core keyed by the C4 ``session_key``. Turns for one session run **serially**
  (prompt-cache safety: a byte-stable prefix + strict role alternation needs
  serial turns), while **different sessions run in parallel** up to a bounded
  concurrency — matching how ``gateway/run.py`` already caches one ``AIAgent``
  per ``session_key``.
* **Identity binds through the C1 seam.** :func:`bind_channel_principal` resolves the
  channel identity to a :class:`~hermes_cli.access.Principal` via
  ``resolve_principal`` and stamps the internal user onto the session source so
  the key isolates per internal user (never per raw channel handle).
* **Channels are prod-only (D5/C3).** :func:`guard_channel_prod` routes every
  channel-originated event through the C3 mode guard, which forces ``prod``.

This is Shape 1 (in-process, reuse the working pollers). Shape 2 (N adapter
instances per account via ``PlatformConfig.accounts``) is the durable target
and is documented in the FG-03 doc; it can be migrated to once Shape 1 proves
out, without changing the C4 contract this module publishes.
