# FG-04 — Goals with priority + measurability/progress

**Wave:** 1 · **Owner agent:** devin:49726ab9 · **Status:** MERGED into `develop` (#15). As of 2026-11-01: no ECS system-test record in this doc

## Summary
Extend the existing per-session goal loop into a **prioritised, multi-goal
registry** where each goal has **measurable success criteria** and **tracked
incremental progress**. Even when metrics aren't given up front, the
self-learning layer **monitors user feedback and proactively asks for the
missing measurement info at appropriate times** (4.1). Goals are
visibility-scoped (per-user / shared; owner sees all).

## Decisions applied
- D1/C2 (per-user vs shared goals), D2 (goal context from hybrid memory), C6 (proactive-ask quiet-hours/consent/rate-limit).

## Reuse map
- `hermes_cli/goals.py` — `GoalState` (status/turns/wait-barriers/subgoals) + **`GoalContract`** (`outcome`, `verification`, `constraints`, `boundaries`, `stop_when`) + the judge loop. **This is the base**; the registry sits *above* the Ralph loop (does not replace it).
- SessionDB `state_meta` (`goal:<session_id>`) — current persistence; app-level registry moves to Supabase `app_*` for cross-session/cross-user querying.
- `tools/approval.py` / consent policy (C6) — for proactive asks.

## Design / approach
1. **Goal registry (above the loop):** persistent, prioritised goals with
   `priority`, `status`, `owner_user_id`, `visibility`, and a **`GoalMetric`**
   set. The existing `/goal` Ralph loop remains the *execution* mechanism for an
   active goal.
2. **`GoalMetric`** (first-class, on/beside `GoalContract`):
   `{name, target, current, unit, source_query, cadence}` so "achieved?" and
   "incremental progress" are **computed**, not vibes. `source_query` reads the
   live store (FG-05) or a tool.
3. **Proactive measurement solicitation (4.1):** a monitor watches feedback;
   when a goal lacks a measurable metric (or progress is stale), it **asks the
   user** — but only through the shared consent/quiet-hours/rate-limit policy
   (C6), and via appended messages (cache-safe). Answers update the metric.
4. **Priority scheduling:** when multiple goals are active, higher-priority
   goals get turn budget first; ties broken by staleness/deadline.

## Data model (Supabase `app_*`)
- `goals(id, owner_user_id, visibility, title, description, priority, status, created_at, deadline?)`.
- `goal_metrics(id, goal_id FK, name, target, current, unit, source_query, cadence, last_measured_at)`.
- `goal_progress(id, goal_id FK, ts, value, note)` — incremental history.

## Dev/Prod + Supabase
Registry in `app_*` via C3. The per-session Ralph loop stays in SessionDB
(core), unchanged.

## Testing requirements
- Baseline: `test_goal_state_baseline.py` (GoalState/GoalContract roundtrip + back-compat) stays green — FG-04 must not break existing goal serialization.
- Unit: metric evaluation (target vs current → achieved), priority ordering, progress append.
- Negative access: user A can't see user B's private goal; owner can.
- E2E: create goal w/o metric → monitor asks (respecting quiet-hours) → answer sets metric → progress recorded → judge sees metric in verdict.

## System testing (system-test box)
**Required step after this FG's development completes** (part of its Definition of Done), on top of the per-PR unit/E2E + baseline gate: deploy this FG to the new ai-prentice-4-all ECS (`hermes-systest`, `i-j6c81aisv2dd8mg17yle`, 4/16, cn-hongkong-b, EIP `47.83.199.25`) — the dedicated **system-test host** — and exercise it end-to-end on the real stack against a **staging** Supabase schema (`app_staging`) + staging SQLite core (**never prod**). See README §7.1. Acceptance checklist:
- Create ≥2 prioritised goals with metrics on the deployed stack; confirm priority scheduling of the turn budget across concurrent goals.
- Trigger the proactive measurement monitor: a missing/stale metric prompts a real ask via Telegram/web respecting quiet-hours (C6); the reply updates the metric and progress is recorded.
- **Gate:** this FG is not complete/promotable until this ECS checklist passes (on top of the per-PR gate).

## Dependencies
- **Blocked by:** FG-13 (C3), FG-01 (C2), FG-05 (context/metric source), C6 (from FG-10/12).
- **Blocks:** FG-09 (goal management).

## Definition of Done
Tests green + baseline green + `ruff`/`ty` clean; registry sits above the Ralph loop without breaking it; metrics computed; proactive asks ride C6; **ECS system test green**.

## Progress checklist
- [x] Goal registry (priority/status/scope) above the Ralph loop — `hermes_cli/goal_registry.py` (`GoalRegistryStore`, C2-scoped `goals`/`goal_metrics`/`goal_progress`/`goal_asks`, C3-routed via `get_store`); Ralph loop in `hermes_cli/goals.py` untouched.
- [x] `GoalMetric` + computed achievement + progress history — first-class `GoalMetric` in `hermes_cli/goals.py` (`achieved`/`progress_fraction`, `at_least`/`at_most`), `verdict_for_metrics` so "done" is computed; `goal_progress` append-only history.
- [x] Proactive measurement solicitation via C6 (cache-safe asks) — `hermes_cli/goal_monitor.py` (`ProactiveMeasurementMonitor` + `ProactiveAskPolicy`: consent/quiet-hours/rate-limit from `config.yaml`); asks delivered only via an injected append-message `ask_fn`, never a system-prompt mutation.
- [x] Priority scheduling — `priority_rank`/`priority_weight` + `schedule_turn_budget`/`order_goals` (weighted budget split, ties broken by deadline/staleness).
- [x] tests (baseline + unit + negative + E2E) green — baseline `test_goal_state_baseline.py` stays green; `tests/hermes_cli/test_goal_metric.py`, `test_goal_monitor.py`, and real-Postgres `test_goal_registry_e2e.py` (incl. negative-access at app layer **and** Postgres RLS). `ruff`/`ty` clean on new files.
- [ ] System test on the system-test ECS passed (see *System testing* section) — **pending owner (Leo)/orchestrator coordination**; this session has no ECS/prod access and does not attempt it.

## Cloud-agent prompt
> **[Wave 1 — start after Wave 0 merges]** Repo `leolau/aquarium`, branch off `develop`. Read `docs/design/master-plan/README.md` and this doc (`FG-04`). Build a **prioritised, measurable multi-goal registry ABOVE** the existing per-session Ralph loop in `hermes_cli/goals.py` — reuse `GoalState`/`GoalContract`/judge, DO NOT replace or break them (`tests/plan_baseline/test_goal_state_baseline.py` must stay green). Add a Supabase `app_*` registry (`goals`, `goal_metrics`, `goal_progress`) with `priority`, visibility scoping (contract C2, owner sees all), and a first-class **`GoalMetric{name,target,current,unit,source_query,cadence}`** so achievement + incremental progress are **computed**. Add a **proactive measurement monitor** (4.1) that watches feedback and, when metrics are missing/stale, **asks the user via appended messages through the shared consent/quiet-hours/rate-limit policy (contract C6)** — never mutate the system prompt. Add priority scheduling for turn budget. Follow `AGENTS.md` (cache-sacred, footprint ladder). Add baseline + unit + negative-access + E2E tests (temp `HERMES_HOME` + throwaway Postgres); run `scripts/run_tests.sh`, `ruff`, `ty`. Edit ONLY this FG doc. Open a PR linking this doc. **Not done until this FG's *System testing (system-test box)* checklist (in this doc) passes** — coordinate that deploy/run with Leo.
